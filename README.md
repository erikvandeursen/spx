The Spotify Playlist Extender (SPX) is my product for the YoungCapital traineeship WAO.

Basically it consists of an API built on top of the Spotify API to enrich playlists of given user.

Using the app enables you to:
- get info on your playlists
- visualize data on your playlists
- use CRUD actions on your playlists
