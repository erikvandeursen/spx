The Spotify Playlist Extender (SPX) is my product for the YoungCapital traineeship WAO.

Basically it consists of an API built on top of the Spotify API to enrich your playlists.

For example:
- get info on your playlists
- visualize data on your playlists

Future plans:
- create new playlists based on audio features
- refactoring the thing and tidy up some code :)
